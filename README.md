# EasierXRAssets

__Latest Unity Version__: 2019.3.13f1

## What is EasierXRAssets?

__EasierXRAssets__ is a custom package created and intended to help developers of VR content in Unity by giving them pre-created tools for basic functions such as locomotion and input device detection.

__EasierXRAssets__ relies on Unity's XR systems. For developers who are working with Oculus's __Oculus Implementations__ package (which is soon to be deprecated), please refer to my other Github repository, "[EasierVRAssets](https://github.com/kimryan0416/EasierVRAssets)".
