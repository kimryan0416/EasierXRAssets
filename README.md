# EasierXRAssets

__Latest Unity Version__: 2019.3.13f1

Hello. My name is Ryan, and this is a guide for the "EasierXRAssets" package. As the developer of this package, I feel that it is strongly within my responsibility to explain what this package is and how to use it.

## What is EasierXRAssets?

__EasierXRAssets__ is a custom package created and intended to help developers of VR content in Unity by giving them pre-created tools for basic functions such as locomotion and input device detection. While working with VR for school projects, I sometimes found that the __Oculus Implementations__ package available in the Unity Asset Store was very cumbersome to use and often had bugs in their code. Fortunately, __Unity XR__ became a big thing, but migrating to that package was also a big pain. I wanted to create a VR toolkit that would be simpler to use and more efficient in terms of workload on the developer who may want to use Unity's XR system rather than the __Oculus Implementations__ package.

__EasierXRAssets__ relies on Unity's XR systems. For developers who are working with Oculus's __Oculus Implementations__ package (which is soon to be deprecated), please refer to my other Github repository, "[EasierVRAssets](https://github.com/kimryan0416/EasierVRAssets)".
